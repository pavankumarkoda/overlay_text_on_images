# Image Text Overlay Script

This Python script overlays a custom number (date) and the current date/time onto images in a specified folder. The text is visually enhanced with shadows and background rectangles for improved readability.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork)
- A TrueType font (.ttf) file for custom text styling

You can install the required Pillow library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pillow
